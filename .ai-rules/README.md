# ai-rules

Structured rules for AI-assisted development. Forces codebase understanding,
acceptance criteria, validation-before-implementation, and human gates at
critical decision points. Includes a first-class design domain for user-facing
UX/UI work.

## The Problem

AI coding agents will happily generate code without understanding the codebase,
skip validation, and mark their own work complete. This leads to features that
compile but don't work, tasks that are checked off but not verified, and scope
that silently drifts.

For user-facing work, the failure mode is different but just as expensive:
agents optimize for a pretty hero screen, skip state design, ignore trust and
error handling, and produce screens that look polished but fall apart in real use.

## The Solution

A set of mandatory rules that enforce:

1. **Codebase analysis before proposals** — AI must document its understanding and get human confirmation
2. **Human-approved acceptance criteria** before any code is written
3. **AI-generated validation steps** before each task is implemented
4. **Observable proof** of task completion (not self-assessment)
5. **Human gates** at critical decision points
6. **Phased project planning** for multi-feature initiatives
7. **Session state persistence** so context loss doesn't mean knowledge loss
8. **Design workflow discipline** for user-facing UX/UI work: intent, journeys, states, trust, hierarchy, and critique

## Design Domain

The design rules are for work involving:
- product UX
- screen and flow design
- information architecture
- design systems
- AI-generated interface concepts
- critique of existing products

They are not a replacement for engineering rules. They are a companion domain
that keeps AI from generating glossy nonsense with no operational backbone.

Start with:
- [Design Principles](rules/design/30-design-principles.md)
- [UX Brief and Intent](rules/design/31-ux-brief-and-intent.md)
- [User Journeys and State Inventory](rules/design/33-user-journeys-and-state-inventory.md)
- [Screen Review and Critique](rules/design/36-screen-review-and-critique.md)

## Install

### One-liner (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonathanPorta/ai-rules/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- **Fresh install:** `git subtree add` the latest release to `.ai-rules/`
- **Update:** `git subtree pull` to the latest release if already installed
- **Abort:** warn and exit if `.ai-rules/` exists but wasn't installed by this script

### Manual: Git Subtree

```bash
# Add as a subtree (pin to a release tag)
git subtree add --prefix=.ai-rules https://github.com/JonathanPorta/ai-rules.git v1.0.0 --squash

# Update later
git subtree pull --prefix=.ai-rules https://github.com/JonathanPorta/ai-rules.git v1.2.0 --squash
```

### Manual: Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/JonathanPorta/ai-rules.git .ai-rules
```

### Manual: Just copy it

```bash
cp -r ai-rules/ /path/to/your/project/.ai-rules/
```

## Platform Setup

After installing, generate platform-specific config stubs:

```bash
# Use the defaults (claude + copilot)
.ai-rules/setup.sh

# Wire up specific platforms
.ai-rules/setup.sh --platforms cursor,windsurf,copilot

# Wire up every supported platform
.ai-rules/setup.sh --platforms all

# Overwrite an existing stub (skips the marker / frontmatter safety checks)
.ai-rules/setup.sh --platforms cursor --force

# See what's supported
.ai-rules/setup.sh --list
```

The setup script creates thin stub files at each platform's canonical config
location. These stubs reference `.ai-rules/AGENTS.md` and leave room for
project-specific additions.

### Platform Details

| Platform | Config Location | Format |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` (root) | Plain markdown; uses `@.ai-rules/AGENTS.md` import |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/ai-rules.mdc` | MDC with `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/ai-rules.md` | Markdown with `trigger: always_on` frontmatter |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Plain markdown |
| Amp | `AGENTS.md` (root) | Plain markdown; Amp walks parent dirs |

Stub bodies live in `templates/platform-stubs/`. To add a platform, edit
`PLATFORMS_TABLE` in `setup.sh` and drop a matching template file there.

## Role-Based Agents

The `agents/` directory contains four complementary agent definitions that
mirror the workflow's human gates. Each role has scoped tool access to
enforce separation of planning, validation, implementation, and review.

| Agent | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| [planner](agents/planner.md) | read, search | Explores the codebase, produces analysis, and generates PRDs with acceptance criteria. Does not write code. |
| [implementer](agents/implementer.md) | read, search, edit, execute | Decomposes approved PRDs into tasks and implements them using validation-first development. |
| [validator](agents/validator.md) | read, search, edit, execute | Writes validation plans and test cases before implementation, then executes them to verify task completion. |
| [reviewer](agents/reviewer.md) | read, search, execute | Reviews completed work against acceptance criteria and produces verification evidence tables. |

These files are instruction prompts, not platform-native agent definitions.
Adapt them to your agent runner of choice — for example, GitHub Copilot's
custom agents feature requires `*.agent.md` files with specific YAML
frontmatter (prompt, tools, MCP servers), which is a per-project wrapping
step beyond what `setup.sh` generates.

These agents divide the ai-rules workflow into distinct roles with appropriate
tool access:

- **planner** handles Phases 1–2 (PRD and task generation). Limited to read-only
  tools to enforce human gates before any code is written.
- **validator** handles the validation-first discipline from Phase 3. Writes
  validation plans, creates failing tests (red phase), and runs all validation
  checks after implementation (green phase). Can write test files but not
  implementation code.
- **implementer** handles Phase 3 implementation. Takes the validator's failing
  tests and validation plan as a contract, then writes the code to make them pass.
- **reviewer** handles Phase 4 (feature verification). Has execute access to
  run tests independently but cannot modify code — enforcing separation between
  implementation and review.

## Concept Boundaries

To keep the layers crisp as this repo grows, each top-level directory has a
single job. Future work should respect the boundary rather than turning any
one of them into a junk drawer.

- **`rules/`** — process law. Always-on instructions every platform stub
  loads via `AGENTS.md`. Governs how every PRD, task, and implementation
  happens.
- **`agents/`** — role definitions. Reference shapes for runners that need
  a per-role prompt (Copilot custom agents, etc.). Not auto-invoked by
  this repo; consumers adapt them to their runner.
- **`skills/`** — triggerable workflow packages. Native-skills platforms
  (Claude Code, Windsurf, Copilot) auto-discover these by their
  `description` field; reference-only platforms (Cursor, Amp) point at
  `.ai-rules/skills/` from their stub. Skills wrap rules with a trigger
  shape and hard gates; they do not duplicate rule content.
- **`hooks/`** *(reserved, not used yet)* — event-triggered enforcement
  that runs in the harness rather than the model.
- **`mcp/`** *(reserved, not used yet)* — external tool/integration
  surfaces exposed via Model Context Protocol.

Decision rule: if it is always-on, it is a rule. If it is a role with
scoped tools, it is an agent. If it is a request-triggered workflow that
preserves human gates, it is a skill.

## How It Works

### Single Feature Workflow

```text
Feature Request
  → Codebase Analysis (AI writes, human reviews)     ← GATE
  → PRD with Acceptance Criteria (human approves)    ← GATE
  → Task Decomposition (human confirms parent tasks) ← GATE
  → For each task:
      → Validation plan (AI writes before coding)
      → Implementation
      → Validation execution (pass/fail reported)
  → Feature Verification (human confirms ACs met)    ← GATE
```

### Multi-Feature Project Workflow

```text
Project Vision
  → Project Brief (human approves)                   ← GATE
  → Phased Plan with Dependencies (human approves)  ← GATE
  → Phase PRDs (human approves each)                ← GATE
  → Phase Task Lists (human confirms parent tasks)  ← GATE
  → Implementation + Validation per task
  → Phase Verification                               ← GATE
  → Next Phase
```

### Design Workflow

```text
Design Request
  → UX Brief (user, job, emotional goal, constraints)
  → IA + Journey Mapping
  → State Inventory
  → Screen Specs / Concept Direction
  → Trust + Feedback Review
  → Accessibility + Legibility Review
  → Design Critique with explicit tradeoffs
```

The core rule for design work is simple: **do not polish a screen before you
understand the flow and state model that screen belongs to.**

## Documentation

- [How to Use](docs/how-to-use.md)
- [Rule Loading Order](docs/rule-loading-order.md)
- [Design Example](docs/examples/design-example.md)

## The Three Types of Criteria

| | Acceptance Criteria | Validation Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | Human | AI | Human + AI |
| **Scope** | Feature-level | Task-level | Phase-level |
| **When defined** | PRD phase | Pre-implementation | Project planning |
| **What it answers** | "What does done mean?" | "How do we prove this task got us there?" | "What must be true to move to the next phase?" |
| **Approval** | Required before any work | Human reviews if desired | Required before next phase |
| **Mutability** | Only with human approval | AI refines as needed | Only with human approval |

## Optional Rules

Some rules are opt-in. Whether each one is active is controlled by the
**Available** and **Enabled** lists under the Optional Rules section of
`AGENTS.md`. To turn a rule on, move it from Available to Enabled (or
vice versa to turn one off). This repo enables a couple by default;
forks can override.

| Rule | What It Does | Enable When |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| [TDD Enforcement](rules/08-tdd-enforcement.md) | Requires red-then-green test evidence | Your team practices TDD and has test infrastructure |
| [Branch, PR, and Commit Conventions](rules/10-branch-pr-commit-conventions.md) | Defines `{initials}/{type}/slug` branches, `type: Title Cased` PR titles, squash-merge default | You want consistent git naming across repos |
| [Styleguide Overlays](rules/11-styleguide-overlays.md) | Loads optional private writing-style guidance from `.ai-local/` | You have a private voice or work styleguide and want the agent to apply it to prose |
| [Human-Copyable Outputs](rules/12-human-copyable-outputs.md) | Writes PR descriptions, Slack posts, etc. to `/tmp/ai-*` files with a clipboard command instead of auto-publishing | You want a tangible draft to review before it lands in GitHub, Slack, or email (enabled by default) |

Optional rules also come with supporting tooling in `scripts/`:
- `tdd-check.sh` — compares git timestamps to verify test-before-implementation ordering

## Forking

To run a fork of these rules for your organization (including a GitHub
Enterprise instance):

1. Fork on GitHub (or create the equivalent repo on your GHE host) and
   clone it locally.
2. Run `./claim-fork.sh` from the repo root. It detects your clone's
   git origin, walks you through replacing the host/owner/repo in
   `install.sh` and the README, and offers to commit the result.
3. Push.

`claim-fork.sh` is interactive, idempotent (re-running on an
already-claimed fork is a no-op), and supports both `github.com` and
GHE hosts. Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing files.

After step 3, the curl one-liner against your fork installs from your
fork — no further edits to `install.sh` needed.

To install from a fork *without* forking yourself, override at the call
site:

```bash
AI_RULES_HOST=github.com AI_RULES_OWNER=alice AI_RULES_REPO=ai-rules-fork \
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alice/ai-rules-fork/main/install.sh | bash
```

For GHE, point `AI_RULES_HOST` at your enterprise host
(e.g., `github.acme.corp`) and use the equivalent `${HOST}/raw/...`
URL for the curl source.

## Extending for Your Organization

These rules are intentionally generic. Fork this repo to add:

- Organization-specific coding standards
- CI/CD pipeline validation steps
- Project management tool integration (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Security and compliance checks
- Infrastructure-specific validation patterns
- Product design system conventions and review requirements

Keep extensions in a separate file or subtree of files and reference them from
your fork's `AGENTS.md`.

## Versioning

Releases are cut automatically on merge to `main`. The version bump is chosen
from the labels on the PRs merged since the last release tag (highest wins:
`major` > `minor` > `patch`):
- `major` (or `version: major`) → major bump
- `minor` (or `version: minor`) → minor bump
- `patch` (or `version: patch`) → patch bump

If a PR merges without a version label, the release falls back to scanning
commit messages: `BREAKING` or `major:` → major, `feat:` or `minor:` → minor,
everything else → patch.

The `.version` file tracks the installed version and origin, used by the
installer to detect updates.
